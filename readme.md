# Discovering the optimal model

For this analysis, I employ ML models in conjunction with ECS (Elastic Container Service in AWS) for computation, leveraging auto scaling for seamless scalability. The infrastructure is automated with Terraform (Infrastructure as Code), and the entire model analysis workflow is streamlined using Python.

In my journey of growth, teachers have been my guiding stars. Testing and practicing continually unveil new insights, making learning a perpetual journey. This story, serving as a learning note, contributes to my growth and comprehension as a newcomer to statistics.
