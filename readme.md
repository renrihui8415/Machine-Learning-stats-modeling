# Discovering the optimal model

For this analysis, I employ **Machine Learning models** in conjunction with Cloud service such as **ECS** (Elastic Container Service in AWS), **EC2** (Elastic Computation System) and **Lambda** for computation, leveraging **auto scaling** for seamless scalability. The infrastructure is automated with **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code), and the entire model analysis workflow is streamlined using **Python**, incorporating a **pipeline**, **grid search**, and **hyperparameter tuning**.

In my journey of growth, teachers have been my guiding stars. Testing and practicing continually unveil new insights, making learning a perpetual journey. This story, serving as a learning note, contributes to my growth and comprehension as a newcomer to statistics.
