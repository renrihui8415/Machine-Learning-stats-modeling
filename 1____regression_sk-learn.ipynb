    "    - It is primarily used for machine learning and predictive modeling. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Input: For example, the model is initialized with LinearRegression(), and the data is fitted with lm.fit().\n",

    "\n",
    "`Classification Models`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nature of Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discrete Labels: Classification models predict categorical outcomes. For example, determining whether an email is spam or not spam (binary classification) or classifying an image into one of several categories (multiclass classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class Membership: The primary goal is to assign input data to one of several predefined categories or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems.\n",
    "- Decision Trees and Random Forests: Can be used for both binary and multiclass classification.\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances.\n",
    "- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Used especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "- ROC-AUC: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Regression Models`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nature of Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuous Values: Regression models predict continuous numeric outcomes. For example, predicting house prices or the temperature for a given day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Value Estimation: The primary goal is to estimate the value of the output variable based on the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression: A fundamental and widely used method for predicting continuous values.\n",
    "- Ridge and Lasso Regression: Extensions of linear regression that include regularization.\n",
    "- Decision Trees and Random Forests: Can also be used for regression tasks.\n",
    "- Support Vector Regression (SVR): An extension of SVM for regression problems.\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Regressors: Similar to classification, but tailored for continuous outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE, providing error in the same units as the output variable.\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "- R-squared: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n"
